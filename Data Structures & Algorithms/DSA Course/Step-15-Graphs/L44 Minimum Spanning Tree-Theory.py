"""
The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is the collection of edges required
to connect all vertices in an undirected graph, with the minimum total
edge weight. The animation above runs Prim's algorithm to find the MST.
Another way to find the MST, which also works for unconnected graphs,
is to run Kruskal's algorithm

A tree in which we have N nodes and N -1 edges and all the nodes are
reachable from each other
