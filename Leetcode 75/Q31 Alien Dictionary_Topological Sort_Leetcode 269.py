"""
There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However, the order among the letter is
unknown to you.

You are given a list of strings words from the alien language's dictionary, where the strings in words
are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language.

Return a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted in lexicographically increasing order
by the new language;s rules. If there is no solution, return "".If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

A string s is lexicographically smaller than a string t if at the first letter where they differ, the letter
in s comes before the in t in the alien language. If the first min(s.length, t.length) letters are the same,
then s is smaller if and only if s.length < t,length.

Example 1:
    Input: words = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
    Output: "wertf"
