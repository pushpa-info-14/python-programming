"""
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}


Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node
with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an
adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set
of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference
 to the cloned graph.

Example 1:
    Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
    Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
    Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
    1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
    2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
    3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
    4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

Example 2:
    Input: adjList = [[]]
    Output: [[]]
    Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with
    val = 1, and it does not have any neighbors.

Example 3:
    Input: adjList = []
    Output: []
    Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
