"""
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be
stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in
the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your
serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized
to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily
need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
